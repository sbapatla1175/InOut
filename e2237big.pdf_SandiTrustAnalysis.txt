2. Expand on Predictability: The speaker's enthusiasm and knowledge are evident, but incorporating
more data-driven insights and specific examples can add predictability and substance to the
conversation, reinforcing the speaker's credibility.

'we' to ensure that the conversation reflects both personal involvement and collective team effort. This
balance is crucial for demonstrating leadership and fostering a sense of unity within the team.
